# Odin-Rock-Paper-Scissors

This was a project part of the Foundations course of the Odin Project but decided
to add extra features I thought would make it more enjoyable. Created a player vs 
player mode in addition to the single player (vs computer) mode. 

To accomplish this, I used the WebSocket API from Node.Js to allow real-time 
two-way communication between players. To manage the data coming from both players,
I hosted the backend on Render as it has built in WebSocket and Node.Js support.

Future additions to this would to be to add a "link" feature where players could
send specific links to each other to join their lobbies and not the entire server.
